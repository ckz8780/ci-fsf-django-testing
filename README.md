# Welcome!

This is a clone of the [django_todo project](https://github.com/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-todo), but has been extended to implement testing. It's part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module for CodeInstitute.

Relevant tests are in: 

- /todo/test_forms.py
- /todo/test_views.py
- /todo/test_models.py
- /todo/test_app.py

The project has been tested to 100% coverage. The coverage report is in `/htmlcov/index.html`. Coverage report has not been launched publicly, so if you want to see it, please clone the repo and take a look locally.

This project has been extended to include bootstrap simply to give it a better UI. Deployments have been automated via a Heroku-GitHub OAuth link. There is a live version at https://ci-fsf-django-todo.herokuapp.com (Note that this is a free dyno and may go to sleep! Please be patient on initial load).
