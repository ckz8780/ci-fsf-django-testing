# Welcome!

This is a clone of the [django_todo project](https://github.com/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-todo), but has been extended to implement testing. It's part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module for CodeInstitute.

Relevant tests are in: 

- /todo/test_forms.py
- /todo/test_views.py
- /todo/test_models.py
- /todo/test_app.py

The project has been tested to 100% coverage. The coverage report is in `/htmlcov/index.html`.
